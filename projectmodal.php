                    Abstract— Since the 1970, beholding technologies have matured to a degree at which exciting
                    applications have become possible for visual substitution. In fact, industry has created a
                    ramification of computer vision products and services by developing new electronic aids for
                    the blind in order to overcome the difficulties that the dog and cane do not respond. This
                    paper provides an outline of assorted visual substitution systems developed in the recent
                    years. It aims also to introduce a proposed method that restores a central function of the
                    visual system which is the identification of surrounding objects. This method relies on
                    video analysis and interpretation. Thus, our contribution is to present a visual
                    substitution system supported evaluating fast and robust algorithms to recognize and locate
                    objects in images. Keywords: Google API, Blind User, Object Recognition
                    I. INTRODUCTION Visually Impaired People confront many problems in moving from one place to
                    another i.e. navigation. Vision is human’s power to notify him of the obstacles in his way.
                    A solution which is easily available is needed to solve the problems of blind people. The
                    application developed can detect the objects in the user surroundings. It can alert the user
                    of the obstacles in his pathway and this fashion helps the user to navigate from one place
                    to another saving him from tripping anywhere. It will also solve the matter of keeping a
                    special device or a walking stick. The reason it is more reliable is because it is developed
                    on the Android operating system and Android-based smartphones are very common and highly
                    available almost everywhere. In fact it is one of the most used mobile operating system.
                    This makes the application convenient to get. Thus in this project, a model has been
                    proposed which makes the use of smartphone, a common device available to anyone and used
                    technology to make an application which can help the blind user detect objects in his
                    surroundings and help him in navigating from one place to another. The output of the system
                    is in audio form that can be easily understandable for a blind user. These Visual impairment
                    present severe consequences on certain capabilities related to visual function:  The daily
                    living activities (that require a vision at a medium distance)  Communication, reading,
                    writing (which requires a vision closely and average distance) − Evaluation of space and
                    also the displacement (which require a vision far)  The pursuit of an activity requiring
                    prolonged maintenance of visual attentions.
                    II. LITERATURE SURVEY This project proposes a system in which two cameras are put on the
                    glasses of a blind person. The proposed work has a wearable device and consists of a blind
                    stick and sensor based detection circuit. It uses an infrared sensor which uses
                    infrared waves to scan the surroundings of a person. It uses object detection and gives them
                    audio information about it. The system must be trained about object information. Feature
                    extraction is also a part of the process. Another system proposed is focuses on giving the
                    information about what are the different types of obstacles in front of the user, their size
                    and their distance from the user. Software is used for signal processing. The camcorder is
                    used for recording videos. Video processing methods using LED display are used after that.

                    It is a system where N object detectors are trained for N different objects. When an image
                    is sent to the system, all object detectors do their work. If an object is found by a
                    detector, it will mark its boundary and label the item name. After the process completes for
                    all N detectors, the image is displayed with all the tags. Moving a cursor over an object in
                    the image shows the complete boundary of the article with its label beside. This system is a
                    little slower than other systems because a lot of object detectors are working on a single
                    image.

                    When the button is pressed, it captures an image of the object through the camera which is
                    connected to it and sends it to Google Cloud. Then Google’s Cloud Vision API uses artificial
                    intelligence and provides relevant results of what the object can be. The output is then
                    converted into audio format through Google’s Text-to-Speech (gTTS). And finally, the
                    converted audio is played using VLC. From a video, objects are detected by taking templates
                    out of the video. It works if the object is present in the whole video.
                    III. PROPOSED WORK The objective of this project is to provide a security for visually
                    impaired people, by adapting methods for face recognition, object detection and currency
                    identification which makes their life easy in today's computer vision
                    technology and also helps in security aspect. Normally, a blind person uses cane as a guide
                    of him to protect him from obstacles. Most of area of surrounding is covered by the cane,
                    especially the area near to his legs like stairs etc. But certain areas such as near to his
                    head, especially when he is entering or leaving the door which is short in height. This
                    system is specially designed to protect the area near to his head. It guides the user about
                    obstacles as well as also provides information about appropriate or obstacle free path.
                    Logical structure: The logical structure of our system is shown in following fig 1. The can
                    be divided into three main parts: the user control i.e image to be captured, sensor control
                    i.e detect the object, and the output to the user i.e speech listen by the blind person.
                    <img src="assets\img\project\pic3.jpg" class="lozad" alt="..."></a>
                    The control such as user control that includes the switches that allow the user to choose
                    project’s mode of operation. Sensor control determines when to tell the sensor to take a
                    measurement and receives the output from the sensor and normalizes it to control value for
                    the sensors.
                    IV. WORKING The work that present in this system is based on the use of new technologies to
                    improve visually impair people mobility. Our research is on obstacle detection so as to cut
                    back navigation difficulties for visually impaired people. Moving through an unknown
                    environment becomes a real challenge after we can’t trust our own eyes. Since dynamic
                    obstacles usually produce noise while moving, blind people develop the flexibility of
                    hearing to localize them.
                    <img src="assets\img\project\pic4.jpg" class="lozad" alt="..."></a>
                    However they're reduced to their sense of touch when the matter is to see where an inanimate
                    object exactly is. The common way for navigating of visionless person is using a walking
                    stick cane or walking cane. The walking cane is a simple and computer dedicated to detect
                    static
                    obstacles on the ground, uneven surfaces, and holes via simple tactile-force feedback. This
                    device is light, portable, but range limited and it's not usable for the protection from
                    obstacles as regards to head area. Another option that has the most effective travel aid for
                    the blind is the guide dogs. Based on the symbiosis between the disabled owner and his dog,
                    the training and also the relationship to the animal are the keys to success for this
                    method. The dog is able to detect and analyse complex situations: cross walks, stairs,
                    potential danger, know paths and more. Most of the information is passing through tactile
                    feedback by the handle fixed on the animal. The user is able to feel the attitude of his
                    dog, analyse matters and also give him appropriate orders. But guide dogs are still off from
                    being affordable, around the price of a nice car, and their average working time is
                    proscribed, an average of 7 years. The work they present in this system is based on the use
                    of new technologies to improve visually impair people mobility. Our research is on obstacle
                    detection so as to scale back navigation difficulties for visually impaired people. Moving
                    through an unknown environment becomes a real challenge after we can’t think about our own
                    eyes. Since dynamic obstacles usually produce noise while moving, blind people develop the
                    flexibility of hearing to localize them.
                    V. CONCLUSION In this paper have presented an architecture for the facial & currency
                    identification geared toward people with visual disabilities. The architecture has been
                    designed and developed with the aim of achieving a sturdy and computationally light result
                    that might be embedded in elements with a moderate computing capacity. It is quite simple,
                    efficient and simple to be understand clearly.
